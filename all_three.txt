GIVEN a player can choose to set a monthly deposit limit monthly to prevent themself from depositing more than than the limit in a rolling 30-day period

AND a player can choose to set a daily deposit limit monthly to prevent themself from depositing more than than the limit in a rolling 1-day period
WHEN the program is run
THEN prompt the user to input a value, convert it to a float and call it daily_input   
    IF the input is a string that won't convert to a float
        throw an exception("Please enter a number") and prompt again
    ELSE IF the input is a negative number
        display an error ("Please enter a positive number minimum 10.00") and prompt again
    ELSE IF the input is a above 0 but less than 10
        display an error ("the minimum is 10.00) and prompt again
    ELSE IF the input is above 10 but less then max_deposit
        create daily_limit and set it to the value inputted into daily_input
    ELSE IF the input is empty OR zero
        continue to the next prompt 
THEN prompt the user to input a value, convert it to a float and call it weekly_input   
    IF the input is a string that won't convert to a float
        throw an exception("Please enter a number") and prompt again
    ELSE IF the input is a negative number
        display an error ("Please enter a positive number minimum 10.00") and prompt again

    ELSE IF the input is above 10 but less then max_deposit
        create weekly_limit and set it to the value inputted into weekly_input
    ELSE IF the input is empty OR zero
        continue to the next prompt 
THEN prompt the user to input a value, convert it to a float and call it monthly_input
    IF the input is a string that won't convert to a float

        create monthly_limit and set it to the value inputted into monthly_input
    ELSE IF the input is empty OR zero
        continue to the next prompt


AND save the values as daily_limit, weekly_limit and monthly_limit
AND print daily_limit, weekly_limit and monthly_limit to the console


AND the minimum limit is 10.00.
AND none of the limits are required.
AND the minimum deposit is 10.00.
AND the maximum deposit is 50000.00.
